Refelction: My biggest takeaway is that in order to create a code project that will last and you can build on it helpos for it to be readible and clean. Three prinicples that stood out were Error Handling, Vocabulary, and Functions. In error handinling I learned that is good and i should not ignore this. In vocabulary, I need to make sure that I am using pronounceable and radable variables for others to understand my code. lastly in functions, I see that it is by far the toughest skill to learn according to the reading so it is important to make it do one action. This way it is easy to reproduce, and work with as well as important to be clean.
